every tasks works properly even with Online python Compiler.👍

But, for Moviesrecommendation.py task, you need to install Python on your computer
 and need to install packages like pandas and scikit-learn

first install python from your preferred browser or Microsoft Store(which i used):

& then, open your terminal, install the following packages by using commands:

pip install pandas

pip install scikit-learn

and then execute the code in your command prompt.👍☺
